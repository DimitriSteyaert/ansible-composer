## Composer

[![Ansible Galaxy](http://img.shields.io/badge/galaxy-DimitriSteyaert/composer-660198.svg?style=flat)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/DimitriSteyaert)


This role basically just installs the PHP dependency manager Composer on your machine. If composer is already installed you can also choose to upgrade this component.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.9`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install DimitriSteyaert/composer
```

### Role dependencies

- `DimitriSteyaert/php-fpm`

Well actually any PHP role should be sufficient, as long as there is a `php` command available in the execution path on your system.

### Role variables

List of default variables available in the inventory:

```YAML
---
composer_version: 1.4.1
composer_parentdir: /usr/local/bin
```

### Detailed usage guide

By default Composer is installed in the directory /usr/local/bin and with version 1.4.1. These 2 variables can be modified to your own liking.
Upgrading or downgrading of Composer on your system can be done by defining another `composer_version`.
